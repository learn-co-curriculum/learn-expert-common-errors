## Common Problems

I just want to take a minute to go over a few common problems we see and how to fix them. 

### All JS methods are undefined

With the newer JS curriculum (the curriculum with Mocha tests), if there is a syntax error in your JS file, the test will not be able to load up the file and will come back with errors saying that all functions are undefined. 

You may be able to pick out the syntax error with your skilled javascript eyes, but in this case, we want to try and give the student the tools to find this error on their own. The quickest solution here is to simply take the code and paste it in chrome console. When you hit enter, you'll get a message that there is a syntax error, and if you click on the note to the right, Chrome will highlight the location of the error for you.

This is a quick way to find the error _and_ give the student the tools find it on their own the next time.
